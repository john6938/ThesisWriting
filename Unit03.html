<p>Simply put, the purpose of the introduction is to create interest in your study. There are many types of information that could be included. The list below includes 11 types of information. However, you should not use all of them. One way to identify which types of information should be included is to refer to graduation theses of other members of your lab. If possible, discuss the possible contents of your introduction with your graduation thesis supervisor. 
<ol>
<li>Give background information about the topic.</li>
<li>Refer to the important findings of other researchers.</li> 
<li>Identify the need for further investigation.</li>
<li>Indicate your plans for further investigation.</li>
<li>State your hypothesis/research questions.</li>
<li>State your aim/purpose.</li>
<li>State your objectives.</li>
<li>Indicate the scope of your study, i.e. the width versus the depth of your research.</li>
<li>Refer to any limitations of your study.</li>
<li>Give a definition of key terms.</li>
<li>Outline the content of each section.</li>

        <div class ="readingText">
<p>The most basic outline for a graduation thesis is IBC: 
<ul>
<li>introduction,  
<li>body, 
<li>conclusion.</ul>
The body section can be divided into three parts and so the outline can be extended to: 
<ul>
<li>introduction,  
<li>method
<li>results,
<li>discussion,
<li>conclusion.
</ul>
To this outline, we can add some two sections: one section at the beginning of the thesis, and  add one section at the end. This gives the following outline: 
<ul>
<li>front matter,</li> 
<li>abstract,</li>
<li>introduction, </li> 
<li>method,</li>
<li>results,</li>
<li>discussion,</li>
<li>conclusion,</li>
<li>references.</li>
</ul> 
Now, we have a basic framework for a graduation thesis. Although in your graduation thesis, you may use different headings.

         <p>The word <i>thesis</i> roughly translates from the Greek word for <i>position</i>. The thesis  statement is a refined and succinct set of arguments that define what you will demonstrate  or prove in the thesisâ€”it is your position. It is the <i>point</i> of your work. The statement  can be very short or many pages in length. If an oral defense were a battle, this is the  ground you fight to hold.</p>
         <p>[Source: <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/science/programs/graduate/computerscience/forms/MSc_Thesis_Guide.pdf">Ryerson University guide on How to Produce a Computer Science Thesis</a>]</p>
         <p>Your thesis statement will probably change during your research, but it is important to try to summarize the arguments that support or underlie your <i>position</i>. </p>

<p>One way to generate a thesis statement is to state the topic, your stance, the rationale for this stance and note any qualifications. Put simply, state your claim or position, the reason for deciding this. Note also any different views and any limitations. The example below shows how the answers to four questions can  be combined into a one-sentence thesis statement (thesis sentence).</p>

    <td>Some people blame the fast food industry for child obesity.</td>

<p>If you wrote in Japanese, use Google Translate to translate your answers into English. Remember these tips.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write short clear expressions or sentences.</li>
  <li>State the grammatical subject.</li>
  <li>Avoid using linking words.</li>
  <li>Link the machine-translated expressions or sentences together yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember statistical machine translation works best for short highly frequent sentences, and the chance for accurate Japanesese-English translations for the contents of your graduation thesis is low (as of October, 2018). Do not rely on Google Translate, but use it as a tool in the same way as a dictionary or grammar book.</p>
