<p><u>Draft 1</u> </p>
<p>
  The sun is very hot [1].  
</p>
<p>Reference </p>
<p>[1] Google result. https://www.google.co.jp/search?ei=oWDiW4XJNoKp8QWYu5PoBw&amp;q=temperature+of+sun+surface&amp;oq=temperature+of+sun+surface&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l4j0i22i30k1l5j0i22i10i30k1.188.1535.0.1872.7.5.0.0.0.0.579.1582.2-3j1j0j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.5.1577...0i10k1.0.eZj_ZhXSDnk </p>
<p><u>Commentary 1</u></p>
<p>This draft is not only very short, but very strange. Everyone reading this graduation thesis will know that the sun is hot, so there is no need for a citation. This citation is also very unclear. Citations should refer to some reliable source. Google is very powerful, but the search engine results change regularly. Any source used should be more stable, such as a journal article. </p>
<div class="readingText">
  <p><u>Draft 2</u></p>
  <p> The sun is approximately 5800 degrees. [1]. </p>
  <p>Reference </p>
  <p>[1] Wikipedia article: Sun. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun</p>
  <p><u>Commentary 2</u></p>
  <p>The graduation thesis now contains information that some people may not know. The source of this information is not the author and so a citation is needed. The source was Wikipedia, but this is not so reliable as it can be edited by anyone. A higher quality source is needed, such as a journal article. </p>
  <p><u>Draft 3</u></p>
  <p> The sun is approximately 5800 degrees. [1]. </p>

  <p><u>Commentary 3</u></p>
  <p>Although the author first checked Wikipedia, the source used is from a peer-reviewed journal and is more reliable. The next step is to add more details.</p>
  <p><u>Draft 4</u></p>
  <p> The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. The sun is approximately 5800 degrees. [1]. </p>

  <p><u>Commentary 4</u></p>
  <p>More detail has been added. However, this sentence was stolen directly from Wikipedia. This is called plagiarism. Plagiarism is when words or ideas are taken but the source is not acknowledged.</p>
  <p><u>Draft 5</u></p>
  <p> The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System [1]. The sun is approximately 5800 degrees. [2]. </p>

  <p><u>Commentary 5</u></p>
  <p>The source for the first sentence is now given, but this is unreliable. Readers of the graduation thesis should already know this so a citation is not necessary if the words are written by the author.</p>
  <p><u>Draft 6</u></p>
  <p> The Solar system comprises planets and a star. Nine planets orbit around the star called the Sun. The sun is approximately 5800 degrees. [1]. </p>
  <p>Reference  </p>

  <p><u>Commentary 6</u></p>
  <p>The general details of the Sun and Solar system do not need citations. There is a citation for the specific detail of temperature. The source of the citation is reliable. This is still very short, but provides a solid basis for an introduction to a graduation thesis related to the Sun.</p>

<p><u>Plagiarism or text recycling</u> </p>
<p>Plagiarism is when you use the ideas and/or words of someone else. Text recycling is when you use the words of someone else. The difference is that when you commit plagiarism, the original sources of the words are traceable. When you recycle text, so many other people have used the same words that the original source is unclear. Plagiarism can easily be detected by using specialist software. In fact, due to the Obokata scandal, many Japanese universities started to use plagiarism detection tools. </p>

       <div class="readingText">
<p><u>Sources and citations</u></p>
<p>Research articles and graduation theses frequently refer to sources. Commonly used sources are research articles, conference proceedings and books. When the idea and/or words are used from a source, a citation is used. There are three common types of citations: quotations, paraphrases and summaries. In short, sources refer to the original location of the words, but citation describes the places that the original idea or words are used (without plagiarism).</p>
