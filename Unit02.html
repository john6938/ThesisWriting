         <p>Each area of computer science and engineering adopts  different conventions and guidelines to follow regarding format, layout,  organisation and language. The structure of your graduation  thesis will depend on the type of thesis. </p>
         <p>There are four common types of graduation thesis.</p>
         <ol>
           <li>practical  (e.g. develop and evaluate software), </li>
           <li>experimental  (e.g. hypothesis testing), </li>
           <li>theoretical  (e.g. mathematical proofs) and </li>
           <li>empirical (e.g. usability studies that use observation and surveys). </li>

         <p class="instruction">Skim  read a graduation thesis. This may be one from your lab, available online or provided by your professor. Hard copies of all UoA graduation theses are available in the library and can be accessed online within the university campus via the UoA Intranet.</p>
         <p class="instruction">Focus on the headings.  Do not try to understand each sentence. Identify which  headings could be classified as introduction, method, results or discussion.</p>

<h4 class="resource">How do you eat an elephant?</h4>


    <p>Many students find that is is difficult to write around 2500 words, and so they delay and delay writing as long as possible. Writing a graduation thesis is like eating an elephant. They are both huge tasks. Both are difficult to do. The usual answer to the question: &quot;How do you eat an elephant?&quot; is &quot;One bite at a time&quot;. The same can be said for your thesis. &quot;How do you write your thesis?&quot; &quot;One word at a time&quot;. </p>
        <img src="images/elephant.png" width="300" height="297" alt="how do you eat an elephant?">
       <p> Your very first aim is simple: write just one word, and then your next aim is the second word, and so on. This course aims to help you break 2500 words into smaller managable chunks of writing. 
        
  To finish 1% of your thesis, you just need to write 25 words.</p>

         <li>(research field) What is the general area of research for your lab?</li>
