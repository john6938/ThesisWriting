<p>A graduation thesis is a collection of sections, such as introduction and method. Some sections harness visuals, such as tables and figures. Each section has a heading and each section contains one or more paragraphs. Paragraphs consist of one or more sentences. In academic writing, longer paragraphs tend to begin with topic sentences, and very long paragraphs end with a concluding sentence. </p>
<p>A typical academic paragraph begins with a topic sentence. This is followed by one or more sentences that support the topic sentence. These supporting sentences can be considered as providing evidence for the topic sentence. </p>
<p>The supporting details may comprise both citations and elaboration. Citations are when you refer to published research. Three common types of elaboration are description, explanation and exemplification (giving examples).</p>

         <p>Each area of computer science and engineering adopts  different conventions and guidelines to follow regarding format, layout,  organisation, language and other conventions. The structure of your graduation  thesis will depend on the type of thesis. </p>
