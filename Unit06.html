<h4 class="resource">Introducing lists</h4>
<p>There are two common types of lists: horizontal lists and vertical lists.</p>
<p><u>Horizontal lists</u></p>
<p>Horizontal lists are written in the same way as a normal sentence.</p>
<p>XXXXXXX include(s) : aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa . bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb , and  cccccccccccccccccccccc .</li></p>

<p><u>Vertical lists</u></p>
<p>Vertical lists are written by placing each list element on a new line.</p>
<p>XXXXXX include(s) : </p>
    <ul>
    <li>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .</li>
    <li>bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb , and </li>
    <li>cccccccccccccccccccccc .</li>
    </ul>
<p>Note that each list begins with a colon. Colons are commonly used to introduce lists. The list elements are divided by commas. The final list item is introduced using "and".  In this template list, the list elements can be words, phrases or clauses.</p>

<p>When creating lists you can use ordered lists (numbered lists) or unordered lists (bullet-point lists). We use unordered lists when it does not matter about the order of the elements. We use ordered lists when it matters about the sequence. Ordered lists can be used to show chronological order and priority order.</p>

  <p>Method sections vary greatly according to the type of graduation thesis. Some common elements include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the method(s) you used to collect your data, conduct your experiments or design your computer programmes.</li>
    <li>the reason(s) for choosing the method(s). </li>
    <li>For example, (1) justifications for choosing a particular method(s), and/or (2) the objectives of the experiments or computer program testing, and the connection with your overall research objectives.</li>
    <li>for experiments, the procedural steps and the materials and apparatus used. For software development, the  software or programming languages used and procedures of testing.</li>
    <li>the way you analyzed your data. For example, (1) treatment of data: qualitative  or quantitative (statistical) tools or software used.</li>
    <li>any limitations of your methodology. This include, for example, time, method,  sample size and other uncontrollable variables.</li>

                        <li>This tense is used to show completion of an action. When you submit your graduation thesis, the method has been finished and so past tense is commonly used. Using past tense emphasizes that the action is finished. It is also possible to use simple present tense, particularly when using a method developed by someone else. If you decide not to use simple past tense, check with your supervisor or professor first.</li>

<h4 class="resource">Language features in a method section</h4>
  <p><u>Verb  tense</u><br>
When  describing procedures, use the simple past tense when referring to the  procedures that you carried out. However, you can use the present tense if you  are describing some standard procedures widely used by other researchers. </p>
  <p><u>Voice</u><br>
    Passive voice is commonly used in describing procedures because your emphasis  is on the procedure rather than the person.</p>
  <p><em>Passive  voice</em><br>
  The specimen was weighed in an  electric balance before the test. Then it  was  placed at the center of the load cell.</p>
  <p><em>Active  voice</em><br>
  We weighed the specimen in an  electric balance before the test.  Then  we placed it at the center of  the load cell.</p>
  <p>Note:  The use of active or passive voice in a graduation thesis depends on the  conventions of different disciplines. You should talk to your supervisor for  the best advice.</p>
  <p><u>Voice  and imperatives</u><br>
    In  the method section, it is common to refer your readers to relevant figures for  more information. There are two ways of doing this. One is to use the  imperative, for example:</p>
  <p>1. See  Figure 2 for the set up of the test.<br>
    2. See  Appendix C for a list of companies participated in the survey.</p>
  <p>The  use of imperatives is common in textbooks and course materials. However, it may  sound a bit impolite if you use them in your graduation thesis.  Remember, your main readers are your supervisor  and other second-readers. One way to avoid using imperatives is to use the  passive voice. We can rewrite the two examples above using the passive voice:</p>
  <p>1. The  set up of the test is shown in Figure 2.<br>
    2. A  list of companies participated in the survey is given in Appendix C.</p>

    <li>(super challenging question) The verbs &quot;started&quot; and &quot;decreased&quot; are in active voice. Since the researcher started the solution at 1%,  we can rewrite the sentence in  passive voice as: &quot;the solution was started at 1%&quot;. So, why can we also use active voice for passive meaning in this case?</li>

  <p><u>2.1 Apples</u><br>
  Liberty apple cultivar <strong>was chosen</strong> for this  study because it <strong>is</strong> highly prone to browning (Kim, Smith, &amp; Lee, 1993).  The apples <strong>were harvested</strong> at commercial maturity in the New York State  Agricultural Experiment Station orchard during the 1998 growing season and  <strong>stored</strong> in the cold room (0−2°C and 90−95% RH). The moisture content of the apples <strong>was</strong> 83.6% [...].</p>
  <p><u>2.2 Anti-browning agents</u><br>
  Five major  groups of chemical compounds [...] <strong>were</strong> either certified ACS grade or analytical grade [...]. Concentration of each  dipping solution <strong>started</strong> at 1% and then <strong>decreased</strong> to lower concentrations [...]. </p>
  <p><u>2.3 Slicing and dipping</u><br>
  Selected apples of uniform  size and color <strong>were washed</strong> by hand and sliced longitudinally into 10 equal  pieces using a stainless steel hand slicer. Ten apple slices <strong>were treated</strong> in  500 ml of dipping solution for 3 minutes and drained. The excess liquid <strong>was removed</strong> on cheese cloth. Samples <strong>were kept</strong> on the laboratory bench at room temperature  for 3 hours.</p>
  <p><u>2.4 Slicing and dipping</u><br>
  The changes  in flesh color of the treated apple slices <strong>were measured</strong> by a Hunter  Colorimeter (Hunterlab D-25, USA) at 10 min intervals for 3 h. The degree of  browning <strong>was expressed</strong> by &ldquo;δ<em>L</em>&rdquo; value [...]. The results <strong>were expressed</strong> as a mean value from three replications  of the 10 measured samples. </p>
<p><u>2.5 Slicing and dipping</u><br>
  Statistical  analysis <strong>was carried</strong> out using a PC SAS package (SAS, 1990). Duncan's multiple range tests (<em>P</em>=0.05) <strong>were performed</strong> to determine any significant  difference among various treatments.</p>
