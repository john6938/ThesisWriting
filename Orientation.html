<h4 class="activity">Activity 6 <i class="em em-thinking_face"></i> </h4>
         <p>This course is designed to help you complete your graduation thesis. This is achieved in two steps. Step one: write. Step two: improve the writing. To improve your writing, you can focus on five aspects.</p>
        <ul>
      <li>Accuracy - the correctness of factual information and grammar</li>
      <li>Brevity - avoiding verbosity</li>
      <li>Clarity - reducing vagueness and eliminating ambiguity</li>
      <li>Objectivity - reducing subjectivity</li>
      <li>Formality	- adopting a suitably formal and academic style </li>
      </ul>
<p>Students tend to make similar errors when drafting graduation theses.</p>
<p class="instruction">Identify the type of error in each of the following sentences. The first one has been completed.</p>
<ol><li>Researches help solve real-world problems.        <u>Accuracy (research)</u></li>
<li>It`s important to write accurately.</li>
<li>I am pleased to report fantastic results.</li>
<li>I think the situation improved little by  little.</li>
<li>The capital of the United States is New York.</li>
</ol>
<p class="instruction">Compare your answers with those of a classmate.</p>
<h4 class="activity">Activity 7<i class="em em-desktop_computer"></i></i> </h4>
         <p class="instruction">Copy and paste the sentences in Activity 6 into the <a href="http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/~jblake/ErrorDetector.html">Error Detector</a>. </p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/~jblake/ErrorDetector.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
         <p>This tool can find many typical errors made by University of Aizu students. Therefore, your focus for the next month should be on writing the content. Near the end of the course, we can focus on reducing the five types errors. Your new motto: content first, grammar last.</p>
